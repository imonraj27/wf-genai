. Can you recollect names of organisms that have more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack nucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of vascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’? The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and chromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the nucleoplasm

. Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities ( Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 mm in length while bacteria

CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 91 formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments. Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile
----------------------------------------
When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You must have wondered and asked yourself ‘what is it that makes an organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life the cell in all living organisms. All organisms are composed of cells

CELL: THE UNIT OF LIFE 103 EXERCISES 1. Which of the following is not correct? Robert Brown discovered the cell. Schleiden and Schwann formulated the cell theory. Virchow explained that cells are formed from pre-existing cells. A unicellular organism carries out its life activities within a single cell. 2. New cells generate from bacterial fermentation regeneration of old cells pre-existing cells abiotic materials 3

. Match the following Column I Column II Cristae Flat membranous sacs in stroma Cisternae (ii) Infoldings in mitochondria Thylakoids (iii) Disc-shaped sacs in Golgi apparatus 4. Which of the following is correct: Cells of all living organisms have a nucleus. Both animal and plant cells have a well defined cell wall. In prokaryotes, there are no membrane bound organelles. Cells are formed de novo from abiotic materials. 5
----------------------------------------
90 BIOLOGY prokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane except in mycoplasma. The semifluid matrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There is no well-defined nucleus. The genetic material is basically naked, not enveloped by a nuclear membrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (the single chromosome/circular DNA), many bacteria have small circular DNA outside the genomic DNA. These smaller DNA are called plasmids
----------------------------------------
. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Antonie Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell. 8
----------------------------------------
. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles. Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER. Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called centrosome which helps in cell division
----------------------------------------
. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic. A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules
