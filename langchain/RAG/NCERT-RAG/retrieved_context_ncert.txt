. Match the following Column I Column II Cristae Flat membranous sacs in stroma Cisternae (ii) Infoldings in mitochondria Thylakoids (iii) Disc-shaped sacs in Golgi apparatus 4. Which of the following is correct: Cells of all living organisms have a nucleus. Both animal and plant cells have a well defined cell wall. In prokaryotes, there are no membrane bound organelles. Cells are formed de novo from abiotic materials. 5
----------------------------------------
. The Mycoplasma are organisms that completely lack a cell wall. They are the smallest living cells known and can survive without oxygen. Many mycoplasma are pathogenic in animals and plants. 2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries of this kingdom are not well defined. What may be ‘a photosynthetic protistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another
----------------------------------------
. Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities ( Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 mm in length while bacteria
----------------------------------------
. Viruses did not find a place in classification since they are not considered truly ‘living’, if we understand living as those organisms that have a cell structure. The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell.
----------------------------------------
. Can you recollect names of organisms that have more than one nucleus per cell? Some mature cells even lack nucleus, e.g., erythrocytes of many mammals and sieve tube cells of vascular plants. Would you consider these cells as ‘living’? The nuclear matrix or the nucleoplasm contains nucleolus and chromatin. The nucleoli are spherical structures present in the nucleoplasm
----------------------------------------
. Various chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’. Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound distinct structures called organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles
----------------------------------------
. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes. All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells (
----------------------------------------
. 8.5 EUKARYOTIC CELLS The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes
----------------------------------------
. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic. A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules
----------------------------------------
. We must stress here that our understanding of the plant kingdom has changed over time. Fungi, and members of the Monera and Protista having cell walls have now been excluded from Plantae though earlier classifications placed them in the same kingdom. So, the cyanobacteria that are also referred to as blue green algae are not ‘algae’ any more
----------------------------------------
. They are generally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells ( shapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma shaped) and spirillum (spiral). The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even though prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All
----------------------------------------
. Viruses are obligate parasites. In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA
----------------------------------------
. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus, MMC, the functional megaspore and female gametophyte?
----------------------------------------
. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Antonie Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell. 8
----------------------------------------
. Describe briefly the four major groups of Protozoa. 7. Plants are autotrophic. Can you think of some plants that are partially heterotrophic? 8. What do the terms phycobiont and mycobiont signify? 9. Give a comparative account of the classes of Kingdom Fungi under the following: mode of nutrition (ii) mode of reproduction 10. What are the characteristic features of Euglenoids? 11
